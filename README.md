# spelunker.vim
Spelunker.vim is a plugin that improved [Vim's spell checking function](https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/options.html#'spell').  
It supports both Camel Case and Snake Case and provides a smart way to correct spelling.

## 1.Installation
### vim-plug
```
Plug 'kamykn/spelunker.vim'
```

### NeoBundle
```
NeoBundle 'kamykn/spelunker.vim'
```

## 2.Usage
### 2.i. Settings
If you are using Vim's `spell`, turn it off (because it will highlight the same words).

```
set nospell
```

### 2.ii. Options
Spelunker.vim offers the following options.

```
" Enable spelunker.vim. (1 / 0) (default 1)
let g:enable_spelunker = 1

" Setting for start checking min length of character. (default 4)
let g:spelunker_target_min_char_len = 4

" Setting for max suggest words list length. (default 15)
let g:spelunker_max_suggest_words = 15

" Setting for max highlight words each buffers. (default 100)
let g:spelunker_max_hi_words_each_buf = 100

" Override highlight group name of wrong spell words. (default 'SpelunkerSpellBad')
let g:spelunker_spell_bad_group = 'SpelunkerSpellBad'

" Override highlight group name of compound spell words. (default 'SpelunkerCompoundWord')
let g:spelunker_compound_word_group = 'SpelunkerCompoundWord'

" Override highlight setting.
highlight SpelunkerSpellBad cterm=underline ctermfg=247 gui=underline guifg=#9e9e9e
highlight SpelunkerCompoundWord cterm=underline ctermfg=NONE gui=underline guifg=NONE
```

### 2.iii. Correct wrong spell
In a buffer with many camel cases, it will suggest same case words. (And snake case also too.)  
This suggestion list is generated by `spellsuggest()`.  
Move the cursor over the wrong spelling and enter the following commands

```
" Correct word to selected word from list.
Zl

" Correct all words in buffer to selected word.
ZL
```

You can also edit directly like a Vim's `c` command.

```
" Correct wrong spell to word you typed.
Zc

" Correct all words in buffer to word you typed.
ZC
```

### 2.iv. Add words to good spell list
Spelunker.vim use `spell` commands provided by Vim as default.  
You can add under cursor word to `spellfile` with following commands (like a Vim commands):

```
" Add selected word to spellfile
" => zg
Zg

" => zw
Zw

" => zug
Zug

" => zuw
Zuw

" Add selected word to the internal word list
" => zG
ZG

" => zW
ZW

" => zuG
ZUG

" => zuW
ZUW
```
